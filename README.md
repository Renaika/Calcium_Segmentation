# Calcium_Segmentation

trial version of my calcium signalling segmentation baseline for astrocytes.
You can load tif files of astrocyte data in 3D (x,y,t).
Then you can apply my baseline on it using default or costumized parameters for the different methods. 
It will take some time to compute (can be some minutes considering how many time frames you include)
The program will automatically open napari with all in between results until the final labelled data. 
You can look at all of them in the grid style or separatly. 
If you want to further investivate them, you can use napari or you can also export the results as tif files in napari and open them in Fiji or other software that you use. 

### Setup
Install [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html),
or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) if you prefer a more lightweight setup.

Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
(On windows, this is included in anaconda and will be available in the anaconda prompt). 
There are many tutorials online, e.g. [this one](https://www.notion.so/zarkom/Introduction-to-Git-ac396a0697704709a12b6a0e545db049).

Clone this repo and navigate into it (if you have a Github account):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Renaika/Calcium_Segmentation.git
cd Calcium_Segmentation
```
If you don't have a Github account, you only have to download the "Master Thesis - Python GUI_V1.ipynb" file into a folder of your choice. 
Open the Anaconda terminal and go to the folder, where you save the notebook file (Change "\Users\User\Downloads\" to your folder path)
```bash
cd \Users\User\Downloads\
```

Next, you should create a fresh conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n newenv CalciumEnv
```

and to activate it
```bash
conda activate CalciumEnv
```

Now you have to install some packages in order for the notebook to run. The fastest way is via pip: 
```bash
pip install napari[all] tk scipy numpy pandas opencv-python connected-components-3d tifffile scikit-learn matplotlib ipywidgets scikit-image notebook openpyxl trackpy
```

Then you can start jupyter, which will open the folder where the notebook is located. 
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Now you only have to open the notebook and press run on top of it for the GUI to open. 

In order to test the software, you can download a test Dataset here: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bOjGZciea4K_-7pFapMeM3odeY7O3FaH?usp=sharing

I would recommend setting the parameters t_end=50 and BKG_Neighbors=20, if you only want to test if the program runs. If you're sure, that it runs on your system and opens Napari with the results, then you can try to see how it works for bigger values, which will take a longer time to compute. 

TODO: Add description of the parameters and recommended values for testing. /Output will be visualistaion of and an excel file in the same folder as the notebook consitsing of final results of Labels and Area=Volume size
